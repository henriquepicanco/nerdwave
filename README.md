# Nerdwave [1.0.2]

This is the theme used on my blog, [Nerdwave](https://nerdwave.com.br). You can suggest changes or make the theme even better. Even, fork this project, to make the necessary changes for you to use this theme in your project!

For example, the Nerdwave logo, in inline SVG, is stored in the file **logo.php**, in *template-parts/brand*. You will need to change this. In addition, the site footer features a specific copyright text for my site. If you want to use it, feel free, but I believe you will prefer to change it. There are no plans to change these behaviors in the short term. It is possible, however, that this will change in the future - but I do not give any guarantees.
